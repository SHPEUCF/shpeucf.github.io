# Dev-In-Training Program by SHPE UCF's Technology Committee 

Dev-In-Training is a program designed to get students familiar with our software development processes and tools at SHPE UCF.
After this program, you will be able to determine if the SHPE UCF Developer Team is right for you and which projects and features you'd love to be involved with.

## Our Tech Stack
The SHPE UCF Technology Committee (SUTC for short) is primarily known for developing the amazing SHPE UCF App (SUA). The SUA is built using the React Native framework in JavaScript. This is then compiled to both iOS and Android and uploaded to the App Store and the Google Play Store respectively.

Here's a command you should never run on a UNIX machine:
```
rm -R *
```
**Why did I mention this? No reason other than I'm testing right now.**
